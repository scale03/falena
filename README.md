**Deep-Kernel File Observability for Kubernetes via eBPF**

Falena is a next-generation observability agent built for high-density Kubernetes environments. It leverages **eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)** and **CO-RE (Compile Once, Run Everywhere)** principles to extract high-fidelity File Access telemetry directly from the Linux kernel.
